## Private Auction

Private Auction is a web3 protocol meant to govern the transfer of auctioned goods in an anonymous way for the seller and the buyer.

## The concept

Once an auctioneer is authorized by the protocol DAO community, a party who wants to sell something must obtain an agreement on the terms for the auction of this item before it is officially listed on the protocol.  Such agreement concerns the floor price, the duration of the auction along with a description and a picture of the good being sold.

Once the item is listed on the protocol, a pre-approved fee is sent by the protocol to the auctioneer and a flat fee is also sent to the protocol.

Then, all the bidding process happens online upon the completion of the auction.
